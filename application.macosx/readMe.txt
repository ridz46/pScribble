If you are a beginner to perspective drawing I would suggest you get a basic idea from this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xn_0wEwZNEU

This tool is meant to assist the user in drawing one, two, and three-point perspectives.
1. Open the application (Run as administrator)
2. The first screen is a black slate without any assistive axis
3. Resize screen by clicking on the edge of the window and dragging
4. Press 1, 2, 3, or 4 for activating the assistive axes for one-point, two-point, three-point birds eye view, three-point worms eye view perspectives respectively
5. Press 'd' to toggle between drawing and non-drawing mode. When in non-drawing mode ie. nothing is marked on the screen even when clicked, you can drag the perspective points to your desired locations, even outside the screen.
6. Press 'r'to reset the locations of the perspective points
7. Press 'f' for free-hand drawing. Click to draw points, or click-and-drag to draw.
8. Press 'l' for line drawing. Click-and-drag to draw.
9. You can toggle between free-hand and line, or between any of the perspective slates, at any point during using the application
10. Press 's' to save your slate as a .jpg file in the "data" folder
11. Press 'x' to clear the slate at any point during using the app
12. Press Control + 'z' to undo last marking, Control + Shift + 'z' to redo. Upto 10 steps
13. In some systems pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4 directly after opening the app might not work. In that case, click on the screen or draw anything random, then press 1, 2, 3, or 4 to activate the desired axes. You can always press x to clear the slate and start afresh with the activated axes.

Thank You.
